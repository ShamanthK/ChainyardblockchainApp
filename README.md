# ChainyardblockchainApp

A simple web app that allows a user to browse block & transaction data from the Blockchain.org blockchain. The user should be able to:

View a single block
View a single transaction on a block
View the latest block

Front End:

The front end is built using React, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.

Note: Instead of using proxy, I enabled CORS plug-in inside Chrome. If the app doesn't work, please enable CORS plug-in.
